# StuDocu Frontend challenge

For this challenge I've used:
- React;
- TypeScript;
- Redux toolkit;
- React Router v6;
- SCSS;
- React Testing Library and Jest for the unit tests;

I completed all the requirements of the challenge and covered most part of the tests for the components and the redux store.

I started by setting up the reducer and the actions of the app. 
After finishing with this task I moved to the layout of the page. I created PageLayout, a component that handles the positioning and responsiveness.  

Next thing to do was to build the components needed for the for this app. The biggest challenge was setting up the tooltip at the right positions. 

Small extra features that I added:
    You can choose 4 different positions of the tooltip
    The form has a field validation and the submit button enables/disables according to the form fields validation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
