# StuDocu Frontend challenge

For this challenge I've used:
- React;
- TypeScript;
- Redux toolkit;
- React Router v6;
- SCSS;
- React Testing Library and Jest for the unit tests;

I completed all the requirements of the challenge and covered most part of the tests for the components and the redux store.

I started by setting up the reducer,the actions and the store of the app. 
After finishing with this task I moved to the layout of the page. I created PageLayout, a component that handles the positioning and responsiveness.  

Next thing to do was to build the components needed for this app. The biggest challenge I had, was to set up the tooltip at the right positions. 

Small extra features that I added:
    You can choose 4 different positions of the tooltip (top, bottom, left and right)
    The form has a field validation and the submit button enables/disables according to the form fields validation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
